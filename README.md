# HowTo

Recomended use venv or virtualenv for better isolation. 

1. Venv setup example:
- `python venv ENV` 
- `source ENV/bin/activate`
2. Install requirements:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (alternatively try add `sudo` before command)
3. Run the script in the root of the repository:
- `python build.py`
4. The script will generate a website. Put it in your folder with name `site`. If the folder does not exist, then create it.

Nice view.
